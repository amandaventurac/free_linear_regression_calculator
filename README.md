# free_linear_regression_calculator

This repository contains the executable file 'free_linear_regression_calculator.exe'.  

This tiny application was created to help students, researchers, and others that need to perform linear regression on '.csv' files. This idea arose during my Ph.D. , when I had to fit many experimental curves daily.  

You can download it for free, and run it on Windows. 

Using this application takes no more than 7 steps:  

      **1) Double-click on free_linear_regression_calculator.exe**

      **2) The opening process can take some seconds depending on your machine** 

      **3) Select the 'csv' file**

      **4) Select which column will be used on the X and Y axis (they should be numerical)**

      **5) Click 'Show Graph' to show the graph, the fit is the red line** 

      **6) Type the number of decimal digits for  coefficients calculation, the default is 2** 

      **7) Click 'Show stats' to show the statistics from X and Y columns and the linear regression equation** 

This application can not deal with missing data. If you have 'Nan', 'Null', 'NI' tags in X or Y column, I recommend you use a notepad to replace them with a numerical value.  The expected 'csv' file should be separated by commas (',').
